# Share_Drawing_Canvas_With_Websockets

## December 1st
Today Steph and I watched the first two of Daniel Shiffman's videos (lesson 12.1 and 12.2). We learned about how to use sockets to communicate to a server, in this case node, so that people anywhere in the world can be seeing and editing the same canvas. We followed through the first video and created a server.js file where we managed to output a line saying "my socket server is running" using powershell. We are now investigating using "npm init". We are having difficulties changing the entry point to our server.js, but other than that we have been successful.
