# Share_Drawing_Canvas_With_Websockets

## December 1st
Today Steph and I watched the first two of Daniel Shiffman's videos (lesson 12.1 and 12.2). We learned about how to use sockets to communicate to a server, in this case node, so that people anywhere in the world can be seeing and editing the same canvas. We followed through the first video and created a server.js file where we managed to output a line saying "my socket server is running" using powershell. We are now investigating using "npm init". We are having difficulties changing the entry point to our server.js, but other than that we have been successful.

## December 4th
Today we tried to solve our entry point error from last week by moving the folder into the D drive instead of the student network. This allowed us to continue and create a package.json file in our server folder. However, we could not add information to the file. We also got an express folder in the package.json folder similarly to Dan in his video, however we had way more folders than he did.
